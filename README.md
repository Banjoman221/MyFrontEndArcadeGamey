## Instructions

The game starts by selecting a character. To Select a character move the selector from right to left to the character you choose and to select the character press the up key. After character is selected use the arrow keys to move the player up down and right to left. If you want to choose another character navigate the character back to the selector and move the selector right to left to choose a new character. To win the game you must navigate the character to the water and get all four stars. Once you win a game it will take you back to the character selector and will tell you how many games you won. If an enemy is hit then it will take you back to the green grass and reshuffle the stars to start again.
